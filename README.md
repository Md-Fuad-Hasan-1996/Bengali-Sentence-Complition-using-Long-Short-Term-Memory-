There are many types of research and development works in this field, but we can hardly find text prediction-related work for the Bengali language. Bengali is the sixth-largest language in the world. This language is spoken by about 260 million people. This huge number of people use this Bengali language on their various platforms. For the benefit of this huge number of people, we suggest technique a that can help the user type more efficiently and faster than usual. In this work, we propose an intelligent typing assistant which is based on artificial intelligence derived by Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM ) model. This model can give suggestions based on the context the writer is writing.

Objectives with specific aims and possible outcomes:

a. To Increase writing fluency, allowing students to generate more writing.

b. To Support vocabulary development and increase variety and complexity of words used in writing.

The possible outcomes of our proposed work:

a. Be able to predict the words of the sentence

b. Time will be saved in writing.

c. There will be less mistakes in writing and much more efficient
